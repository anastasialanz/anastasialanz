### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on building a site that catalogs outdoor gear warranties using Next.js.
- I'm currently reading [Responsible JavaScript](https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-javascript) and [From Chaos to Successful Distributed Agile Teams: Collaborate to Deliver](https://www.jrothman.com/books/from-chaos-to-successful-distributed-agile-teams-collaborate-to-deliver/).
